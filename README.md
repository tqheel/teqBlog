# teqBlog README

teqBlog is yet another simple blog tool written in C# and ASP.NET MVC.

However, the real goal of the project is to make my photos taken on mobile devices instantly (or at least within a few minutes) available in a resized (smaller res) format in an images folder within the website file tree.

More information is available (or will be shortly) at [my teqBlog project page](http://tqheel.github.com/teqBlog/).
