        <h3>teqBlog: The ASP.Net MVC Blog Tool That Automatically Posts Your Images From DropBox</h3>

<h2>The Problem:</h2>

<p>I want to save images from my iPhone (or any device) to DropBox and have it automatically resized and immediately avilable for posting on a blog. Optionally, the image could be automatically posted to a blog.</p>

<h2>The Solution:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A console application that monitors a particular folder in DropBox (I'm using DropBox, but you could use any local directory) and does the heavy 
        lifting mentioned above (i.e., copies to website folder and resizes images).
    </li>
    <li>The DropBox app for iOS. No DropBox Developer API access is needed. I'm using DropBox purely as an end-user: uploading photos taken with an iPhone
        to a specific folder that syncs with a desktop or server locally. Note that the source of the photo could be any device: PC, Mac, Android, etc. 
        You don't even have to use DropBox. You could could configure the app to use any old directory that contains photos or other images.
    </li>
    <li>A simple ASP.NET MVC 2.0 blog app that uses the Entity Framework "Code-First" approach to generate the model. The real brains of this app
        is the console app that monitors the source image directory and resizes the photos. You could use this console app with any 
        blog platform, as long as you are can execute a Windows console .EXE.
     </li>
    <li>
        SQL Server Compact Edition (a light-weight, file-based version of SQL Server) for storing the post data. 
    </li>

        It's worth mentioning that my inspiration for this project was <a href="https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack" target="_blank">
        Marco Arment's "Second Crack" blog engine project,
        </a>
         though I am not utilizing 
        any of his code. Thanks for the idea, Marco!
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>What's Complete</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The console application, "teqChecker".</li>
    <li>A basic blog tool for creating a blog post and viewing all current posts in the db. There is not yet a provision
        for making use of the uploaded photos (yeah, I know, this is the whole point but you are welcome to use your own blog tool with teqChecker 
        if it pleases you! ;) )
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>What's On My Current To-Do List</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Obviously, image posting capability is job one.
    </li>
    <li>A post editor of some sort (I'm thinking of using the EpicEditor, MarkDown JS-based editor), so HTML markup can be utilized in posts (actually, this may be job 
        one, now that I think about it. Hmmmmm...).
    </li>
    <li>Add user authentication through the ASP.Net Universal Membership Provider (I've been told it works with SQL Server CE.)</li>
    <li>
        <a href="#marco">I mentioned being inspired by Marco Arment's tool earlier</a>. I would like for my blog tool to be capable of importing a static text file from a monitored folder and 
        and automatically post it on the blog site, just like Marco's.
    </li>
    <li>I've thought about adding an optional FTP function for folks who want to use teqChecker with a shared hosting deployment. I have not need for 
        this at the moment, but I can see how it could come in handy for others. If there is some interest shown, I might be willing to give it a shot (feel free to fork 
        my project and send me a pull request with your mods, of course).
    </li>
